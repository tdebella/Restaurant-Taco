- [What we learned](#what-we-learned)

  - I met the designer first time & looked at the design together. We had enough time to ask questions 
    and discuss the functions of certain features.

  - Working with a good designer can be a great experience. We took the opportunity to learn some new tools
     (e.g., figma) and clientâ€™s requirements.
     
  - I learned how to use the git/github.com (code push/pull, resolved merge conflict, etc...)

  - React Functional components and reusability

  - React file and folder structure

  - media queries for satisfactory responsiveness

  - how to deploy the websites
